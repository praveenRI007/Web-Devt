<h2>JavaScript const</h2>

<p>Declaring a constant object does NOT make the objects properties unchangeable:</p>
\
<pre>
    The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

        Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

        Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.

        Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
</pre>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

// Change a property:
car.color = "red";

// Add a property:
car.owner = "Johnson";

// Display the property:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Car owner is " + car.owner; 
</script>
